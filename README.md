<h3> Fake !80 </h3>
A Fake Predeccesor Of <a href="https://www.hmhco.com/programs/read-180-universal"> Read 180 </a> that is simply a copy of a website meant to fake out teachers/friends for an retouching feeling of power which tbh is a very nice feeling sometimes (this can also be used to get out of read180 sometimes) <br>

<br> <h3> How To Fake </h3>
It's Very Simple, <br>Firsly you need to login lol, and get to the main test page where all the small icons are to basically called (HomePage) and just simplly download the big image that showcases the segment (copy it/download it) and uploading as the replacment in the `assets/` folder (its a long file with ending extension `.jpg`

<br>

It's very usefull for a lot of things (but mainly to get out of working)
